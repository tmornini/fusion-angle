# AGENTS.md

This file guides coding agents working in this repository.
Claude Code reads it through `CLAUDE.md`, a one-line
`@AGENTS.md` import stub.

Deno 2.9.6 runs `./test`, `./test validate`,
`./bin/build`, `./test browser`, `./bin/measure`,
and both generators, each invoking the `deno` CLI
directly. `postgres-lib`'s eight inline programs
pipe into `deno run --frozen` on stdin. `./deploy`
composes the walk origin, and `./bin/serve` execs
the `deno compile` binary, which embeds the
runtime — neither calls `deno` itself.

Deno is the only server-side runtime this repository uses;
the browser is the other, and runs the pages. No script
invokes `node` or `npm` (pinned by
`tests/root-scripts-exec-deno.test.ts`); there is no
`package.json` and no
`node_modules`, and `deno.json` sets `nodeModulesDir:
none`. `deno.json` and `deno.lock` are the whole dependency
surface, and Deno resolves the `node:` and `npm:`
specifiers in them itself. A `node:` specifier is
therefore not a `node` process: `npm:postgres@3.4.9`
needs no npm CLI, and a `node:path` import resolves with
no `node` binary on `PATH` at all.

**Commit before building.** `./bin/build` and `./deploy`
require a clean working directory.
Run `./test validate` to catch type errors and lint issues;
commit; then build or deploy.

`./bin/serve` and a local `./bin/measure` sweep need
`POSTGRES_URL` and `JWT_HMAC_SIGNING_KEY` already
set. `./bin/serve dir/ port` sets `PORT`
from `port`. `./deploy --local` mints those for its
children.

When running under the Claude Code sandbox:

```bash
./deploy --local 8080 --postgres mock-data
# open http://localhost:8080/landing/index.html
```

There is no temp bundle — compose down is the trap.
`localhost` is reachable from the sandbox, so the
Chrome MCP tools can drive the page normally.

The sandbox cannot write `~/Library/Caches/deno`
either, so `export DENO_DIR="$TMPDIR/deno-dir"` before
any `deno` command and before `./test` or `./deploy`.
Both are agent-environment accommodations, never baked
into a repo script: the operator's machine writes both
defaults.

## Gates

`./test validate` composes `deno check --frozen api shared
server tests web-app`, then `./test` — `Deno.test`
suites written against `@std/assert`, run as `deno
test --frozen --parallel --no-check
--sanitize-ops --sanitize-resources` with three
preloads, in two TZ passes: `TZ=UTC` on
`tests/*.test.ts`, then `TZ=Pacific/Honolulu` on
`tests/tz/*.test.ts` — then 78-character lint of code
and scripts (not `.md`), the `org` identifier ban
under `api/`, `web-app/`, `tests/`, and `shared/`,
then `generate-schema-svg --check` and
`generate-api-documentation --check`, both `deno run`.
Clean tree for `./bin/build`, `./deploy`, and
`./bin/measure`.

`./test` takes 9.5 s with the sanitizers on, against
9.6 s for Deno before Part 5 turned them on and 16.2 s
for the old Node `node --test` baseline. `--no-check`
costs nothing: `deno check` has already covered
`tests/`. `./test postgres` carries the same two
sanitizer flags; `./test browser` carries
`--sanitize-resources` only, because `useBrowser()`
opens one CDP WebSocket per file in
`Deno.test.beforeAll`, whose pending receive always
crosses a test boundary — the reason lives in that
script's own comment block.

`./test browser` needs Chrome (`CHROME` or
`CHROME_DEBUG_URL`); it bundles with `deno bundle`
into `$TMPDIR` on any tree and runs
`tests/browser/*.test.ts` under `deno test` serially.
It is not part of `./test validate`; `./deploy --local`
runs it after `./test postgres`.

Three layers verify this product. Layer 1 is
`./test validate`, the gate on every commit. Layer 2 is
`./test validate browser` — Layer 1 then `./test browser`
— the operator's gate before `./bin/build`, a deploy, or
a walk. Layer 3 is the serial walk
(`./deploy --local 8080 --postgres mock-data`, then one
explorer through TEST-PLAN.md); it is exploration and
gates nothing. A browser observation changes product
only through a red test at Layer 1 or Layer 2: a
product commit may cite a TEST-PLAN mitigation stub
only when its `Reproduced by` names a red test.

`./bin/measure` is not part of `./test validate`; it
needs Chrome. Full ceremony: `--record` + `--write-budgets`
+ `--runs 25` + `--visualize`. `--check` gates
median readyMs against `measurements/budgets.json`.
`--base-url` hits a running origin (needs `--password`).
See `./bin/measure --help` for flags.

## Commit

Commit completed, tested work. Do not ask.

Going-forward discipline (the Office of the Commit is the full
doctrine):

- One concern per commit — tiny, semantically contiguous.
- Subject: a single line ≈50 chars, present-tense imperative,
  no prose body beyond the mandated `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- Never move/rename and change content in the same commit.
- Linear history — rebase and fast-forward, never merge.

## Worktrees

Every spec rides its own worktree — spec, plan, and each
execution commit — created once the slug is known and
before the first file. The slug names branch, directory,
plan (`<slug>.md`), and spec (`<slug>-design.md`).

```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/<slug> -b <slug>
cd .worktrees/<slug>
git rebase master     # amend until every commit is green
./test validate        # ./test validate browser before a build or walk
cd -                  # the main checkout
git merge --ff-only <slug>
git worktree remove .worktrees/<slug> && git branch -d <slug>
```

`.worktrees/` is gitignored. Red on the branch is fine;
red on landing is not. `--ff-only` fails if master moved
— rebase again; `-d` refuses stranded work. Never `-D`,
never force-push: rebase rewrites hashes, so branches
stay local. One worker per worktree; master owns 8080.

## Subagents

Subagents inherit no scripture and read no AGENTS.md by
default. Every subagent prompt MUST begin with the literal
phrase `Go to Medium Church!` — this invokes the
`church-of-code` skill in the subagent's session and directs
it to read the Medium scroll
(`CHURCH-OF-CODE-medium-context.md`), not the Full one. The
Medium scroll keeps every doctrine and trims only
elaboration; at fan-out the token economy compounds. A
subagent unproselytized is a heathen given a hammer.

**The scroll policy is codebase-wide.** The master session
reads the Full scroll (`Go to Church!`); every dispatched
subagent reads the Medium scroll (`Go to Medium Church!`).
This governs all work in this repo — the master conducts and
keeps the complete voice, the subagents fan out and pay the
Medium price. Even the doctrine audit ([AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md))
follows this: its orchestrator conducts as master and goes
Full, while its explorer, auditors, and refuters fan out as
subagents and go Medium.

The scripture is universal; the codebase is local. After
the proselytization, the dispatching agent MUST also push
down the codebase-specific patterns the scripture itself
cannot know:

- **Voice rules.** 78-char max line in files
  `./test lint` still lints, 4-space indent, no
  inline styles (use CSS custom properties + classes per
  DESIGN-SYSTEM.md), present-tense imperative
  commit messages, Co-Authored-By trailer.
- **Commandments touched by the task.** Name them.
- **Abominations the task specifically risks.** Name them.
- **Existing codebase patterns to match.** RequestContext
  as the first argument to adapter methods, SafeHtml from
  presenters, snake_case storage / camelCase domain,
  HTTP-verb adapter naming (`getNoun`/`putNoun`/`deleteNoun`/
  `postNounOperation`), validators at the gate not
  downstream, no untyped `any` from external boundaries.

Proselytize first, then brief — the scripture loads via the
skill, the patterns load via the prompt.

Subagents work in the dispatching agent's worktree and never
create their own — never pass the Agent tool `isolation`.
Subagents never run `./deploy --render`.

## Where things live

- `api/` — REST, derives, validators, auth/tenancy
- `docs/` — superpowers specs and plans
- `measurements/` — budgets, history, measure-viz
- `server/` — boot, HTTP adapter, seed/wipe, throttle
- `shared/` — wire schema + utilities; never imports `api/`
- `tests/` — `Deno.test` (memory; `tests/tz/` TZ pass);
  `tests/fixtures/` holds the shared per-test seams:
  `console-capture.ts` (swap a `console` method for a
  recording stub for one body), `local-storage.ts`
  (swap `globalThis.localStorage` for one body via
  `defineProperty`, sync or async, restoring the
  previous value in a `finally`), and
  `fetch-discarding-body.ts` (a `fetch` that cancels
  the response body so the resource sanitizer does not
  see it as a leak, for tests that assert only status
  and headers)
- `web-app/` — pages, adapters, presenters, CSS

Run `ls`.

## Invariants that bite

### Tenancy and the named covenant

Org rides the VERIFIED token claim, never the path.
De-membership, demotion, and revocation bite at next
mint, refresh, or exchange, or access TTL (≤ 15 min).
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) `## Tenancy`.

### Write authorizer 403s before genesis

Org-scoped PUT / DELETE hit `writeAuthorizerFor` so a
foreign id 403s rather than genesis-ing in the caller's
namespace. Genuine absence still 404s. See
`api/write-authorizer.ts`.

### HTTP only

Page URLs use relative paths (`/ideas/` or
`/ideas/index.html`). The API is `/api/…`. One origin
(`Deno.serve` inside the compiled binary). Testing is HTTP-only.

### node:crypto scrypt

`server/scrypt-hash.ts` is the one product-process `node:` import
(`node:crypto` scrypt). A Deno or `@std` scrypt landing retires
the import, not the algorithm: credentials written since the
scrypt cutover read `$scrypt$ln=17,r=8,p=1$…`, so scrypt
verification must outlive the swap. Older `$pbkdf2-sha256$`
secrets still exist and rehash on login
(`api/authentication.ts:1544`). `shared/password-hash.ts`
dispatches on the PHC algo-id, so a second algorithm can take
new passwords without touching the old ones.

Anchor the specifier on its quote, and match `process` as a
word — `process\.` cannot see `process?.`:

```bash
grep -rnE "['\"]node:|\bprocess\b" web-app/app/*.ts \
    server/ api/ shared/
```

Twelve lines. One is the `node:crypto` import above. Two are
`api/access-token.ts:31` and `:35`, where the Node-compat
`process` global is typed and then read through optional
chaining (`runtime.process?.env?.[…]`) — a real reader that
the narrower `process\.` pattern silently clears, leaving a
one-line false all-clear. The remaining nine are the English
word: eight in comments, one in the page keyword string
`'flow, process,'` at `web-app/app/page-registry.ts:177`.

Dropping the quote anchor adds nine more non-specifier hits:
`node: GraphNode`, a domain property name, in `flow-graph.ts`
(×3), `flow-operations.ts` (×3), `mermaid-generate.ts`, and
`api/types.ts`, plus the comment naming `node:crypto` at
`server/scrypt-hash.ts:2`. The identifier is right and the
pattern is wrong. `tests/` is outside the sweep on purpose:
its files still import `node:test`.

### Operator seed and wipe

The `fusion-angle` executable has three verbs: `serve`,
`seed`, and `wipe`. `./bin/postgres-seed` runs
in-process on an empty database and refuses a
non-empty one. `./bin/postgres-wipe` is the
public-schema reset; it does not seed.

### Same-tab refresh; other browsers stale

A successful write notifies this tab via pub-sub and
posts `fusion-angle:data` so other same-origin windows
refresh. There is no LISTEN and no SSE client. A
second browser stays stale until navigation.

### Field values reference attributes by id

The message-plane body stores `attribute_id` as a
record-attribute document id, never a table named
`attributes`. See `api/derive-state-field-values.ts`.

### `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`

deno.json enables this — array / object index access
returns `T | undefined`, requiring a `!` or a guard.

### One type universe, no browser fence

`deno.json` is the only project: `strict`, DOM plus
`deno.ns`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `erasableSyntaxOnly`.
The `deno check --frozen api shared server tests
web-app` roots succeed the root project's `include`. The
browser project's `exclude` registry has no successor,
and neither does the fence it served.

Ambient Node globals unlock per INVOCATION, not per
file: one `node:` specifier anywhere in the checked
graph gives `process` to every file in that check, and a
type-only `import type … from 'node:fs'` is enough.
`npm:` does not unlock — `npm:postgres` and the bare
`postgres` mapping both still reject `process`.
`web-app` no longer carries a `node:` importer of its
own — the Deno port took the last one — but the gate
checks it in one invocation with `server` and `tests`,
and either alone suffices: `server/scrypt-hash.ts`'s
`node:crypto` unlocks it even with `tests` excluded. So
`deno check --frozen api shared server tests web-app`
passes a file under `web-app/app/` whose only line is
`process.env.HOME`. Nothing under `web-app/` is
type-fenced against `process` today, and `Deno.*` never
was: `deno.ns` sits in the lib array.
`tests/browser-fence.test.ts` checks a hermetically
isolated file, so it passes whatever the real property
is — a green run is not evidence of a fence.

The browser is what catches a stray `process` or `Deno.*`
in client code now — a runtime `ReferenceError` that
`./test browser` (Layer 2) and the walk (Layer 3) see
only on a path they exercise. TODO.md carries the oracle
for a gate that would restore the fence.

`erasableSyntaxOnly` and `verbatimModuleSyntax` were
adopted because `node --strip-types` required them at
runtime. Deno requires neither: with no config at all it
both runs and checks an enum and a namespace. They stay a
deliberate repo choice, and `deno check` and `./bin/build`'s
`deno compile` bind them now — `deno compile` type-checks
unless told not to, and `build` passes no `--no-check`, so
an enum or namespace is TS1294 at either gate under this
`deno.json`. What the choice buys is that every `.ts`
file here stays strippable rather than compiled, so type
erasure alone is enough to run this source.

### `localStorage` is real under Deno

Deno ships a live Web Storage global whose store
persists across processes, so assigning
`globalThis.localStorage` is ignored.
`tests/local-storage-stub.ts` installs the writable
in-memory fake the tests then stub. `./test` loads it
as a `--preload`, not an import.

### Required env is never logged

`POSTGRES_URL`, `JWT_HMAC_SIGNING_KEY`, and
`PORT` are required. Never log them.

### Transaction bodies await only row ops

Every `transaction(…)` body awaits ONLY row ops —
validators, crypto, hash, `serializeWire`, and scrypt
run OUTSIDE the tx. Sync compute between row ops is
fine. Nested `view.transaction` re-enters the same
tx; its tables must be a subset of the outer set.
A transaction holds its pooled connection and its
advisory locks for its whole body; the memory backend
serializes whole transactions, so a long body stalls
every other op.
