// The server half of the request vessel (Office of the
// Context): one context enters at the gate and rides the
// pipeline, and each field is set exactly once, at the step
// that resolves it. This module owns the entry stage; the
// authentication and fence steps enrich it downstream. The
// vessel is loggable BY COVENANT — it never carries the
// bearer token; authentication reads the header from the raw
// Request and the secret stays there. Route handlers keep
// their (adapter, params, body) contract: the route table is
// the chosen boundary where the vessel hands the base
// adapter to the handler.

// The request id travels the whole hop chain: the facade
// rewrite re-enters handleRequest with this header so the
// inner hop keeps the outer request's id — one user request,
// one trace.
