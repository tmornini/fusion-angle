# Flow Canvas

This file is the canvas contract. Storage lives in
ARCHITECTURE.md `## Flow graph`. Work orders (claim expiry,
all-see-all) live in ARCHITECTURE.md `## Work orders`. Heat
ramp tokens live in DESIGN-SYSTEM.md `## Heat ramp`.

## Layers

The Flow Designer (`flows/detail.html`) renders an SVG
canvas with pan, marquee, drag, and edge connection.

- `flow-layout.ts` — Sugiyama layout
- `flow-graph.ts` — SVG render
- `flow-interactions.ts` — pointer/keyboard state
  machines (discriminated unions). Pan toggles via Space:
  one tap on, one tap off; the toggle is ignored
  mid-gesture; focus promotes to selection via
  `canvas-focus`. Space toggles pan whenever the canvas
  or a node/edge inside it has focus. Enter opens the
  properties panel for the focused node or edge. Nodes
  carry `role="button"`; this overrides the ARIA
  Space-as-activate default deliberately — pan is the
  canvas Space binding.
- `mermaid-{generate,parse}.ts` — round-trip text format
- `zip.ts` — in-browser ZIP
- `adapters/flow-export.ts` — integration point

The canvas operates on the domain `GraphNode` /
`GraphEdge` (`memberIds`, `agentIds`, `attributes`). The
live graph is pair-plane only — see ARCHITECTURE.md
§ Flow graph for storage, reassembly, and write
semantics. `getFlowGraph` reads through `ctx.GET` and
parses the returned graph into the domain `FlowGraph`.
`flow-mutations.ts` builds a client-minted save delta
(node/edge upserts, `deletions: GraphDeletion[]`
(eventId/entityId/at), member/attribute `'added'`|
`'removed'` ledger events). Lifecycle `'deleted'`/
`'restored'` are derived from deletions/revivals, not
delta action tokens. Undo resolves its restore target
from the flow's own document-pair history (server-side);
reviving a previously removed node/edge id posts a
`'restored'` event so the tombstoned id reappears.

## The FSM seam

The FSM (`flow-fsm-reduce.ts`) propagates its new state
to the presenter via the `request-update` action payload,
consumed by `detail.ts` through
`presenter.withInteractionState(state)` — the single
sanctioned seam, no shared mutable state. After every
commit the page pushes the committed interaction state
back in the gesture context, so a gesture reduces from
the committed camera. The page restores canvas focus
after every rebuild in `update()` (`canvasFocusOf` /
`restoreCanvasFocus`).

## Gesture rendering

While a gesture is in flight (drag, pan, marquee,
connect), `detail.ts` routes `request-update` payloads to
`flow-gesture-render.ts` instead: one narrow
attribute-level mutation per animation frame (node
transform, affected edge `d`/label, marquee rect, viewBox
+ grid, connect-preview layer), built from the same pure
geometry the full rebuild uses (`computeEdgeGeometry`,
`buildConnectPreview`, `marqueeDrawRect`). The presenter
snapshot stays at the gesture-start state; pointer-up
lands the final state through the sanctioned seam and a
full rebuild. With Auto-Fit on, the camera re-fits at
gesture end, not per move. Pointer-moves force no layout
reads: the interaction layer captures the canvas rect at
gesture start and maps client points through the FSM's
own viewBox — exact, because the viewBox always shares
the canvas aspect ratio and `svg.flow-canvas` carries no
border or padding.

## Camera rules

The properties panel is positioned on the LEFT
(`pages-flow-detail.css` `.flow-props-panel` uses
`left: 0`); the visible canvas occupies pixels
`[PANEL_WIDTH_PX, canvasW]`. When the panel is open, both
Auto Layout (`applyAutoLayout`) and Auto Fit
(`fitBoxToCanvas`) account for the panel-occupied left
portion via `PANEL_WIDTH_PX`. The detail page's
`reconcileFitFromDom` runs Auto Fit only when `isAutoFit`
is true (no-op otherwise), so panel toggles and selection
updates re-fit the visible canvas symmetrically without
re-laying out nodes.

Viewport scale/translate operations (zoom, pan, Auto
Fit, panel toggle, selection centering) MUST NOT invoke
Auto Layout.

Explicit auto-layout fires only via
`withAutoLayoutToggled`, `withLayoutReconciled`, and
the `withNodesMoved` chain — never via `withFitToBox`
or `withSelectionCentered`.

The detail-page `request-update` callback MUST NOT move
the camera from pointer-down to pointer-up: a release
hit-tests the node under the pointer, so a camera moved
under an in-flight gesture misses the node the user
aimed at. At gesture start it commits
`withInteractionState` and nothing else, and keeps the
selection the gesture started from. Every other update,
gesture end included, runs `reconcileFitFromDom` after
`withInteractionState` so the auto-fit viewBox is the
final state, not stomped by the FSM's frozen viewBox;
when the selection differs from the one before the
update (at gesture end, the one the gesture started
from) while the panel is open, it then runs
`withSelectionCentered` to pan the newly selected node
to the visible canvas center (zoom unchanged).

## Special nodes

The two special nodes (`isCreate` / `isArchive`) persist
their `name` field directly as "Create" and "Archive" —
no constants, no render-time override. The flow renderer,
the stats renderer, the properties panel header, and the
mermaid generator all read `node.name` and emit it
verbatim; persistence and presentation share one
vocabulary. `isCreate` and `isArchive` are properties of
the graph node, not state values. Work-order node id
versus the claim alphabet lives in ARCHITECTURE.md
`## Work orders`. The mermaid parser does not translate
either: a legacy `.mmd` file that names its special nodes
`[Start]` / `[End]` imports with those literal names,
surfacing the staleness rather than masking it via a
shim.

## Members and attributes

Regular nodes (not start/end) carry a
`memberIds: MemberId[]` field (zero or more person
members / identities) and an optional
`agentIds: AgentId[]` field (live `/ai-agents` ids). The
panel body renders a `<fieldset>` with two
`<div class="member-group">` children — HUMANS and AIs —
each holding a labeled `<input type="checkbox">`. Humans
carry `data-member-id="<id>"`; AI checkboxes are
display-only (`data-ai-member-id`) until a roster seat
names an agent. The fieldset respects `isLocked` (every
checkbox `disabled` when locked). On change, the panel
collects every checked human into a `MemberId[]` and
dispatches the node-property-update action via the pure
helper `parseMemberIdsFromPanel(panelEl)` in
`flows/detail.ts`.

Regular nodes also carry `attributes: NodeAttribute[]`
(`{ attributeId, mode, isRequired }`). Hidden is encoded
by absence from the array. `mode` is `'editable'` or
`'readonly'`. The per-node panel renders one row per ref
with a mode picker + Required checkbox + remove button,
plus a picker `<select>` listing every record_attribute
on the bound Record not yet referenced. The flow header
carries a Record-binding `<select>` driven by
`getRecordForFlow` / `postFlowRecordBinding` /
`deleteFlowRecordForFlow`.

## Hazards

Hazards are two-tier and shared across the designer +
stats canvases via the pure predicate
`shouldShowMemberHazard(node, allEdges)` in
`web-app/app/flow-graph.ts`. Precedence: `isCreate` /
`isArchive` → no hazard ever; zero members → `'danger'`
(red `iconNoEntry`, class `.flow-node-danger` /
`.flow-stats-node-danger`); zero outgoing edges (strict
dead-end) → `'danger'`; exactly one member → `'warning'`
(yellow `iconAlertTriangle`, class `.flow-node-warning` /
`.flow-stats-node-warning`); two-or-more members AND at
least one outgoing edge → no hazard. Both badges sit in
the bottom-left of the node, mutually exclusive at the
slot.

Three call sites of the same predicate: `flow-graph.ts`,
`flow-stats-aggregate.ts`, and
`adapters/flow-publish.ts`. The aggregate model emitted
by `flow-stats-aggregate.ts` carries the resolved level
on each node as
`memberHazard: 'warning' | 'danger' | null`; the stats
renderer reads it directly.

## Publish gate

The flow-publish gate is the third call site.
`validateFlowForCreation(flow)` in
`web-app/app/adapters/flow-publish.ts` returns
`{ ready: boolean, problems: FlowProblem[] }` —
`zero_members(nodeId)` and `dead_end(nodeId)` variants —
and `getFlowsForCreation(ctx)` partitions the unlocked
flows into `{ ready, notReady }` (locked flows are
excluded) for the workbox "Create Work Order"
dropdown. The picker renders two sections: READY
(clickable, carries `data-flow-id`) and NOT READY
(disabled, no-entry icon, "N nodes need attention"
subtitle, no `data-flow-id` so the click handler ignores
it). The client adapter `postWorkOrderCreation` re-runs
`validateFlowForCreation` and throws before POST if the
picker was somehow bypassed — defense in depth at the
client boundary.

## Stats variant

The read-only stats variant (`flow-stats`) uses its own
renderer `flow-stats-graph.ts` and presenter
`FlowStatsPresenter`, deliberately not a parametrization
of `flow-graph.ts`/`FlowDesignerPresenter`. It shares
only the pure pieces: geometry constants (`NODE_WIDTH`/
`NODE_HEIGHT` from `flow-layout.ts`, `NODE_RADIUS` /
`GRID_CELL` exported from `flow-graph.ts`), the
already-exported edge-path helpers (`perimeterPoint`,
`whichEdge`, `controlOffset`), `findCycleEdgeIds` from
the pure `flow-cycle-edges.ts` (the designer's back-edge
DFS, extracted so both renderers mark loop-backs
identically), `iconAlertTriangle` and `iconNoEntry` (the
two hazard icons). Node positions, though, do not come
from the renderer: `getFlowGraph` runs
`flow-graph-layout.ts`'s `withRenderableLayout`, which
lays a flow out (`computeLayout`) whenever domain
`isAutoLayout` is set (wire `is_auto_layout` on
FlowWithGraph) or its stored positions are degenerate —
so the stats renderer and the designer both start from
real coordinates, not the persisted (0,0) placeholders.
`runFlowLayout` / `runLayoutFromInputs` is the one
`computeLayout` wrapper, shared by `getFlowGraph`, the
designer's `applyAutoLayout`, and `flow-export`'s
mermaid-import path.

Its emitted SVG carries none of the editor's
interactivity tells (no `<animate>`, `role="button"`,
`tabindex`, connection ports, `data-connect-port`,
`aria-current`) and no paint either — edge/node strokes,
the arrowhead, the loop-back dash all live in
`pages-flow-stats.css`; the renderer emits structure
(`d`, `transform`, `x/y`, `class`, `data-*`) only. The
one presentational inline attribute is the per-node
`style="--heat-t:${t}"`; CSS computes the fill via the
4-stop ramp in DESIGN-SYSTEM.md `## Heat ramp`. Loop-back
edges carry `data-cycle="true"` → CSS dashes +
warning-colours them, mirroring the designer; the single
`#stats-arrow` marker's head tracks each line's own
stroke via `fill: context-stroke`, so default / on-path /
cycle arrows match for free. Path selection highlights
via `data-on-path` / `data-dim` (off-path fades and
desaturates, leaving the lit path the only colour on the
canvas), never an animated filter — the editor uses a
glow; the stats canvas does not. A path is lit by default
(the most-travelled one), so
`.flow-stats-body:has([data-on-path])` accent-flags the
stepper bar — itself an eyebrow-labelled widget
("Most-traveled paths") — tying control to canvas. The
aggregate logic lives in the pure module
`flow-stats-aggregate.ts` (`buildFlowStats(input) →
model`); it consumes the universal `TransitionEvent[]`
shape exported from `adapters/work-orders-queries.ts` —
derived from each joined work order's `versions/` in chain
order (`getWorkOrderVersions`, `workOrderEventsOf`). The I/O
wrapper is `adapters/flow-stats.ts`'s
`getFlowStats(ctx, flowId, nowMs)`.

## How we got here

This file is the canvas contract. The stats canvas is a
separate renderer on purpose.
